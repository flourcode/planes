PlanePatrol ✈️
PlanePatrol is a lightweight, immersive web application for live global aircraft tracking. It combines real-time flight telemetry with local weather data and a unique "Cockpit View" ride-along feature, all contained within a single HTML file.
🌟 Key Features
Live Traffic Tracking: Visualizes aircraft in real-time using data from airplanes.live.
Immersive Cockpit View: Tap any plane to enter a 3D "Ride Along" mode that follows the aircraft's perspective with a pitch-accurate HUD.
ASMR Audio Engine: Procedurally generated engine sounds that adapt based on aircraft type (Jet, Prop, Helicopter) and flight phase.
Live Weather Integration: Displays local temperature, wind speed, and sky conditions based on your GPS location.
NEXRAD Radar Overlay: Real-time precipitation radar overlay for tracking weather systems relative to air traffic.
Mobile-First Design: Optimized for mobile devices with touch controls, haptic feedback, and PWA (Progressive Web App) support.
Pin Drop Mode: Tap anywhere on the map to "teleport" your radar location to explore air traffic globally.
🚀 Quick Start
PlanePatrol is a zero-dependency, single-file application.
Download the index.html file.
Open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge).
Allow Location Access when prompted to find aircraft near you (or deny to default to the central US).
Note: For the best experience on mobile, use the "Add to Home Screen" option in your browser to launch it as a standalone app.
🎮 Controls
Main Radar View
Pan/Zoom: Standard touch/mouse gestures to navigate the map.
Tap Plane: Select an aircraft to enter Cockpit Mode.
Tap Map (Empty Space): Moves the radar center to that location ("Pin Drop").
WX Button: Toggles the NEXRAD weather radar overlay.
Refresh Button: Resets the view to your current GPS location.
Range Selector: Switch radar range between 3, 5, 10, or 20 miles.
Cockpit Mode (Ride Along)
Back Button: Returns to the main radar map.
Sound Icon: Toggles the procedural engine noise.
HUD Data: Displays Altitude, Ground Speed, Vertical Speed, Heading, and Distance from your location.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Core: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+).
Mapping Engine: MapLibre GL JS.
Audio: Web Audio API (Custom procedural noise generation for engines).
📡 APIs & Data Sources
PlanePatrol aggregates data from several public APIs:
Data Type
Source
Aircraft Telemetry
Airplanes.live
Weather Data
Weather.gov API
Radar Tiles
Iowa State University Mesonet
Map Tiles
CartoDB & ArcGIS

🔋 Optimization & Performance
The app includes several internal optimizations:
Dynamic Polling: API requests pause when the tab is hidden or inactive to save battery and data.
Smart throttling: Map and Cockpit updates run on independent, throttled loops to maintain high FPS without overheating devices.
Offline Handling: Graceful error states and "Systems Offline" overlay when network connection is lost.
